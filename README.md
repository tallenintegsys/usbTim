This is just a base implementation for a USB peripheral. I am increasingly needing more speed than I can get from asynchronous serial (UART). This is mostly derived from avakar/usbcorev. I'm currently working with an Orangecrab. I am inticipating more part shortages so I am reluctant to get in bed with say Xilinx (vis-a-vis propritary IP) as China implodes.
